# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle solution
This is a solution to the [Pricing component with toggle challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pricing-component-with-toggle-8vPwRMIC).

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS
